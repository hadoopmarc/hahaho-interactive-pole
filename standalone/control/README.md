# Standalone Control scripts for the HaHaHo Interactive Pole

The webAll script is intended to be the template for complete firmware versions of the Interactive Pole (/src/pole-library, /src/pole-party, etc.). It includes all requirements for a web interface to the Interactive Pole: as a dashboard at /dash, a serial monitor at /serial and OTA update functionality at /update. The webAuth, webDash, webSerial and webOTAblink scripts provide a single element of the complete web interface and can be used for study, debugging or further development of the control scripts.
