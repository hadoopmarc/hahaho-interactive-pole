# Hahaho Interactive Pole
The Interactive Pole is a standalone fun device that can be positioned in supervisioned public spaces. It features an activation button, various sensors, loudspeakers and several lighting and display options. The pole as displayed below originated from a project for the Amsterdam Police, carried out by one of the members of the Hahaho Foundation. It assisted in randomly selecting people for arms control on the street.

The joined membership of the Hahaho Foundation feels that the remaining prototypes can serve for applications with a higher fun factor and we will use the interactive pole as a project in which people of all skill-levels can participate. If you live near Utrecht and want to see the pole in action, check our [website](https://hahaho-makers.nl/) for our biweekly meetings.
